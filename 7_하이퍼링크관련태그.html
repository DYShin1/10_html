        What is Lorem Ipsum?
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        emaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets contai
        g Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker includin
        g versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        Why do we use it?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
        t its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
        pposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing p
        ackages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' wi
        ll uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by ac
        cident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
        Where does it come from
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin l
        iterature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney Co
        llege in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and g
        oing through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes fr
        om sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, wri
        tten in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
        of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.
        32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
        ccompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
